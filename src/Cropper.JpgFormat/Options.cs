2. That if you distribute the Software in source code form you do so only
   under this license (i.e. you must include a complete copy of this license
   with your distribution), and if you distribute the Software solely in
   object form you only do so under a license that complies with this
   license.
3. That the Software comes "as is", with no warranties. None whatsoever.
   This means no express, implied or statutory warranty, including without
   limitation, warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular

   this disclaimer on whenever you distribute the Software or derivative

5. That if you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to the
   Software for a person's use of the Software, your license to the Software
   ends automatically.
6. That the patent rights, if any, granted in this license only apply to the
   Software, not to any derivative works you make.
